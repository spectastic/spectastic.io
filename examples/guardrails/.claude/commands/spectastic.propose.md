# /spectastic.propose

You are scaffolding a **change proposal** for an existing spec. The proposal is a single
self-contained HTML artifact that captures *what's changing*, *why*, and *which requirements
it touches*. Output lives at `specs/<spec-id>/changes/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/proposal.html`.

## Why this format

The change-proposal artifact carries three load-bearing decisions:

1. **One file per change.** Intent, scope, approach, deltas, and a scoped task list live in
   named sections of a single `proposal.html` — not spread across separate documents the
   reviewer must stitch together.
2. **Typed deltas, no silent failure.** Every `<spec-delta>` carries an `op` attribute
   matching `added | modified | removed | renamed`, plus a `target=` pointing at the
   requirement ID. Wrong or missing `op` renders the visible label `MISSING OP`. There is no
   loose hash-counting or freeform header parsing to fail silently.
3. **Inline rendered preview.** ADD and MODIFY deltas embed a complete
   `<spec-requirement>` showing the post-state exactly as it'll appear when archived.
   Reviewers see what they're approving without running `git diff`.

Read `examples/proposal.html` once before writing your first proposal.

## Inputs

User input (from `$ARGUMENTS`): a change name or one-line description ("add OAuth login",
"deprecate the deferred CLI requirement").

## Procedure

1. **Locate the spec.** If the user named a Spec ID, use it. Otherwise scan `specs/` for the
   most recently modified spec or ask one clarifying question. Resolve to `specs/<spec-id>/`.

2. **Pick a slug.** Convert the change name to lowercase-kebab-case (≤ 40 chars). Combine
   with today's date: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>`.

3. **Create the change folder**: `specs/<spec-id>/changes/<date>-<slug>/`.

4. **Copy** `templates/proposal.html` to `specs/<spec-id>/changes/<date>-<slug>/proposal.html`.

   **Adjust asset paths on copy.** The template's `<link>` and `<script>` use `../assets/spec.css` (one level up — correct for in-place preview from `templates/`). The destination is four levels deep, so on copy rewrite `../assets/` → `../../../../assets/` for both the stylesheet and the script. Adjust any link to the parent spec (`<a href="../spec.html">`) similarly: `../../spec.html`.
   Adjust the relative paths to `../../../assets/spec.css` and `../../../assets/spec.js` if
   the template uses different paths.

5. **Skip what's known.** Before any interview, check `$ARGUMENTS`, the live spec, and any sibling proposal folders for context you already have. Don't re-ask. Only interview for what's genuinely missing.

6. **Two-phase interview.** Discovery in chat (narrative), decisions via `AskUserQuestion` (bounded choice). The proposal's `<spec-questions>` register should be empty by write-time unless something is genuinely undecidable today. Represent zero per `REQ-AUTHOR-005`: no `<li>` in the register (a `<p>` rationale is fine), never a "None" `<li>` — each `<li>` reads as one open question to consumers.

   **Chat phase (narrative answers):**
   - **Intent** — why this change, in one or two paragraphs. The reviewer should understand the motivation before reading the deltas.
   - **Approach** — one or two paragraphs. Architectural choices that aren't obvious from the deltas themselves.
   - **In-scope items** — what's explicitly included.

   **Decision phase — use `AskUserQuestion` to anchor each of these before writing:**
   - **Change shape** — Additive (only ADD) / Corrective (MODIFY + REMOVE) / Mixed / Rename-only
   - **Status to ship at** — `proposed` (more review wanted) / `under-review` (ready to share) / `approved` (apply-ready)
   - **For each delta candidate** the chat phase surfaced, ask the **op** explicitly: ADD / MODIFY / REMOVE / RENAME — one question per delta or batched multiSelect for several at once
   - **For each REMOVE** — get both `reason` (one-line) and `migration` (one-line) as separate chat answers (these are free-text, not multiple-choice — use chat). If either is empty, refuse to write the delta.
   - **Out-of-scope items** — for each, ask `defer-to=` target via `AskUserQuestion` with options: a known sibling spec ID / `TBD-<topic>` / `never`

   Rules:
   - ≤4 questions per `AskUserQuestion` call; loop as needed.
   - Use chat (not `AskUserQuestion`) for narrative content: intent paragraphs, requirement bodies, reason/migration text.
   - Don't write the proposal until the decision phase is complete. An unresolved decision becomes a `<spec-question>` only if it genuinely can't be settled now.

7. **Discipline**:
   - Every `<spec-delta>` MUST carry `op` and `target`. Never emit a delta without both.
   - For `op="added"` and `op="modified"`, embed a full `<spec-requirement>` inside the delta
     showing the post-state. The reviewer's eye lands on what they're approving.
   - For `op="removed"`, fill `.reason-block` and `.migration-block` with substantive
     content. "Reason: redundant" is not substantive.
   - **Verify every `target` ID exists** in the live spec for `modified | removed | renamed`,
     and **does not exist** for `added`. Hallucinated IDs are worse than no IDs.
   - Status pill defaults to `proposed`. The user updates it to `under-review` when sharing,
     `approved` when accepted, `applied` after archive, `withdrawn` if abandoned.

8. **Declaring supersession (`REQ-CHANGE-010`).** If this proposal *corrects* an earlier one rather than extending it — reverses its decision, or moves the work elsewhere — declare that on the wrapper:

   ```html
   <spec-change id="<date>-<slug>" status="proposed" supersedes="<earlier-date>-<earlier-slug>">
   ```

   On apply, the fold marks the named change's phase's **unchecked** tasks `data-status="superseded"`, annotated with this change and its title. A **checked** task is left as it stands — a ticked box records work that happened, and retiring it would rewrite history to tidy a count.

   Apply **refuses** if the named change has no archived proposal on the target. It does *not* refuse when the change resolves but its phase is gone — a phase legitimately vanishes when `/spectastic.tasks` regenerates the tracker — and instead reports that it marked nothing.

   **When to reach for it:** author a proposal that contradicts a still-undrained phase and you have created a false backlog. A drain reads an unticked box as work owed, because that is what the format promises. Three rounds on one obligation across three specs left 16 tasks describing work that must never be done.

8b. **Fill the subtraction register** (`REQ-CHANGE-011`). Before the risk pass, ask what this change *takes away* — a clause dropped from a requirement you retyped, an obligation a sibling requirement loses, a behaviour or affordance no requirement records. One `<li>` per item inside `<spec-subtraction>`; **leave it empty if the answer is nothing**, which is a real answer and needs no prose. Where a delta removes something itself, its own reason and migration stay authoritative — this register is for what no delta can express.

   Ask it here rather than after the deltas are written, because the question is cheap while it can still change the draft. Three changes in one day would each have removed something silently: an ADD restated a live requirement minus its no-network clause; a MODIFY dropped a MUST and four rationale sentences; a change to tick semantics would have removed the only visual signal a retired task has. The adversarial pass catches these — as the last and most expensive line, not the first.

9. **Adversarial risk pass.** Before the splitting nudge runs, decide whether the proposal needs an adversarial risk pass per `REQ-CHANGE-004` of the meta-spec.

   **Heuristic — run the pass if any of:**
   - The proposal touches a `priority="must"` requirement (target ID resolves to `must` in the live spec, OR an ADD/MODIFY post-state declares `priority="must"`).
   - The proposal has any `op="removed"` delta.
   - The proposal touches **two or more** distinct topic prefixes (e.g. `REQ-AUTH-*` and `REQ-LIFECYCLE-*`).

   The splitting-nudge at step 9 catches multi-delta scope; **do not** stack `>1 delta` on top of this heuristic — it would fire on nearly every proposal and train `--no-adversarial` muscle memory.

   **Flag overrides:** `--no-adversarial` skips even when the heuristic fires; `--adversarial` runs even when it doesn't.

   **Spawn the critic Agent** — via the Agent tool with `subagent_type: spectastic-critic`, so it runs on the model that definition pins (`inherit` — the session model; adversarial risk-finding is the one fan-out kept on the strong model, spec 044 US3). Inputs: the drafted proposal HTML, the live spec, `./principles.html`, the project's `knowledge/` corpus if present (055-corpus-in-review), and (if known) the originating inbox card path. Use this prompt verbatim:

   > Identify exactly three risks in this proposal:
   > 1. The single change most likely to be regretted in 30 days. Cite the specific `<spec-delta>` target or quote the phrase being objected to.
   > 2. The single requirement in the live spec this proposal most likely contradicts. Cite the REQ ID.
   > 3. The single concern about the proposal's scope — too broad, too narrow, or wrong topic group. Cite the `§Scope` item.
   >
   > If a `knowledge/` corpus exists in this repo, add a fourth risk: a requirement in the live spec that contradicts a domain fact committed under `knowledge/<pack>/references/`. Cite the contradicted `KB-NNNN@edition`. No `knowledge/` directory ⇒ skip this fourth risk entirely.
   >
   > Empty findings are forbidden. If no risk passes the "would I regret this in 30 days?" test for any applicable slot, return `<spec-risk status="no-value-found">` with a one-sentence justification. Three `no-value-found` in a row escalates to the user before archive.

   **Embed the findings** in the proposal's §5 Risk register as one `<spec-risk target="…" status="identified">` per finding. Every `<spec-risk>` MUST carry a `target=` (delta ID, REQ ID, or `§<n>` anchor); missing renders the visible label `MISSING TARGET`.

   **Author response discipline:** the propose-session LLM MAY draft an initial response into `<div class="response">` per risk, BUT the LLM MUST leave `status="identified"`. Status transitions — to `accepted`, `mitigated`, or `rejected` — are the user's commitment, not the LLM's. The user-authored status field is the gate; LLM drafts are starting points.

   **Record the dispositioner (`by=`, per `REQ-CHANGE-004`).** When a `<spec-risk>` status leaves `identified` for `accepted | mitigated | rejected`, the disposition MUST record `by=` on that `<spec-risk>` — the human who dispositioned the finding (`name · handle`, the recording shape the author's choice), never an automated agent. It stays empty while `identified`. This is the source the `Acked-by` trailer reads (spec 027). The propose-session LLM MUST NOT fill `by=` with itself: like the status field, `by=` is the user's commitment. If the user commits a transition in the same session (e.g. via the decision interview), record `by=` naming them; otherwise leave it empty for the user to fill when they disposition.

10. **Budget-aware splitting nudge.** Before finalising the proposal, count the deltas. If the proposal contains **more than ~5 deltas**, or touches deltas across **more than 2 topic prefixes** (e.g. `REQ-AUTH-*` and `REQ-RENDER-*`), stop and ask the user: *"Would these read better as two or three smaller proposals?"* The cost of a small proposal is one extra archive call; the cost of an oversize proposal is review fatigue and merge ambiguity. The default answer is "yes, split" unless the deltas truly share a single intent.

11. **Check for sibling proposals.** Before emitting, scan `specs/<spec-id>/changes/` for other proposal folders whose deltas target any of the same IDs as this one. If found, report them and ask the user how to sequence — concurrent proposals on the same target are the most common archive-time conflict.

12. **Update the proposal's changelog** with today's date and one-line summary of the change
   intent.

## Output style

- Replace every `[PLACEHOLDER]`. Never leave one in the final file.
- Paragraphs short. Reviewers skim proposals more aggressively than specs.
- Use `<spec-note>` for non-obvious approach details; `<spec-warning>` for risks; tasks as a
  simple `<ul>` with checkbox inputs. The §6 task list is the change's implementation breakdown:
  on `/spectastic.apply` it folds into the target's `tasks.html` as a new phase that
  `/spectastic.implement` drains (per `REQ-CHANGE-006`), and the archived proposal §6 becomes the
  frozen intent record. Write each task as one concrete file/dir of work, the way `tasks.html` tasks read.

## After writing

Report: the proposal path, the count and breakdown of deltas (e.g. "2 added, 1 modified,
1 removed"), and the next step — typically the user opens the file in a browser to review
before sharing.

Suggest `/spectastic.apply <date>-<slug>` as the follow-up when the proposal is approved.

## Optional: CLI dispatch

Per 006 FR-009: for deterministic dispatch outside Claude Code (CI scripts, raw shell automation), the LLM MAY invoke `spectastic propose` via Bash. This bypasses LLM-driven file handling and routes through `@spectastic/core/commands/propose` directly. The markdown procedure above remains canonical; the CLI is an alternate code path.

The CLI requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment for AI-coupled verbs; the slash-command path uses the in-host Claude session and needs no key.
