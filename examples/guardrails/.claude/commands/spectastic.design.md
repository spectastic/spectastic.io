# /spectastic.design

You are producing the **design doc** for an existing spectastic specification — the implementation design that answers _how_ we will build what the spec describes. Pair every design with exactly one spec.

## Inputs

User input (from `$ARGUMENTS`): a Spec ID such as `001-auth-service`, or empty (defaults to the most recently modified `specs/<id>/spec.html`).

## Procedure

1. **Locate the spec**. Resolve to `specs/<spec-id>/spec.html`. Read it in full — you need every requirement and success criterion before you design.

2. **Estimability gate (refuse to design if blocking).** Before scaffolding anything, scan the spec for blockers:
   - Any `<spec-question>` admonition still open
   - Any `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` marker still in the text
   - Any `<spec-out-of-scope>` `<li>` missing `defer-to=` (shows as visibly broken)
   - Any INVEST row in `<dl class="invest">` marked with `<dd class="fail">`
   
   If any of these exist, **stop immediately** and report the blockers as a numbered list with file location. The user must resolve them before you design — guessing past unresolved questions causes the spec inflation that small-batches discipline is meant to prevent.

3. **Locate the principles** at `./principles.html` (optional — skip if absent). You will validate against its principles in the design's **Principles check** section when it exists.

4. **Copy** `templates/design.html` to `specs/<spec-id>/design.html`.

   **Adjust asset paths on copy.** The template's `<link>` and `<script>` use `../assets/spec.css` (one level up — correct for in-place preview from `templates/`). The destination is two levels deep (`specs/<spec-id>/`), so on copy rewrite `../assets/` → `../../assets/` for both the stylesheet and the script. Adjust any `<a href="../principles.html">` similarly to `../../principles.html`.

5. **Run the Principles check**. Walk every principle. For each, mark `OK`, `EXCEPTION`, or `VIOLATION`. An exception requires a justification logged in **Complexity tracking**. A violation requires the user either to revise the design or amend the principles — stop and ask.

5b. **Read the profile marker (if present).** If `.spectastic/profile.json` exists (a project scaffolded via `spectastic init --profile`, spec 041), the chosen profile carries an *enforcement policy* — the categories (formatter · linter · type-checker · security · supply-chain · test-runner) its rigor requires. In the design, add a short **Toolchain / enforcement** subsection that resolves that policy to the concrete tools for this design's ecosystem, following the escalation ladder: (1) wire the ecosystem's standard gate (e.g. Ruff/mypy, Error Prone/SpotBugs, clippy, clang-tidy); (2) if a convention isn't expressible off-the-shelf, author a custom rule (Semgrep/ast-grep); (3) if the ecosystem lacks a tool, build a minimal checker (the Verified/Enterprise "build a checker when none exists" duty). Run `spectastic enforce` to see which required categories the project already covers, and design only the gaps (spec 042). Lower profiles (Lean) have no enforcement floor — skip the subsection.

   **Append the stack's ignore entries (spec 043).** Now that the ecosystem is settled, run `spectastic gitignore --stack` — it detects the stack and merges the build-artifact ignores (`node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `target/`, …) into the spectastic-managed `.gitignore` block, additively and idempotently (it never touches your own rules outside the block). The base block was written at `init`; this adds the stack half.

6. **Ground the design in verified truth (read before you interview).** Per `REQ-LIFECYCLE-006`, before any interview question, resolve every design-bearing fact against real source — the same discipline `/spectastic.explain` applies to explanations. Don't design from memory or from how a library "probably" works.

   **Read the real ground** (this is a `SHOULD` — ground the facts a decision will actually rest on, not every file for its own sake). For each requirement and success criterion, identify what the design will *touch or depend on* and open it:
   - **Consuming code** — the modules/functions this feature calls into or extends. Read the real signatures and control flow (Grep/Glob/Read, or the LSP tool's `goToDefinition`/`findReferences`), not just the file tree.
   - **Dependency signatures** — confirm the symbol/option you intend to use exists at the *resolved lockfile version* (open `package-lock.json` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` / `Cargo.lock` / … for the real version, not a newer one).
   - **Platform / runtime constraints** — record the actual number for any quantified limit the approach assumes (rate limit, payload cap, timeout, supported runtime).
   - **Language-idiom feasibility** — before committing an architecture, confirm it *fits the target language's hard constraints*, the way a staff engineer in that ecosystem would check by reflex: does the type system allow the shape (e.g. Java/Kotlin **sealed** hierarchies, Rust ownership/lifetimes, Go's no-generics-until-1.18, Swift value vs. reference semantics)? Is the **initialization / declaration ordering** legal (forward references, cyclic modules, static-init order)? Does the pinned toolchain/runtime version actually support the API? Ground these as `spike` (compile a throwaway snippet) when unsure — a constraint discovered at implementation is a mid-drain propose, which is exactly the failure this prompt exists to prevent (meta-spec triage `T-013`).
   - **Existing patterns** — how the codebase already solves the adjacent problem, so the design *extends rather than regenerates* it.

   **Classify each design-bearing fact** as one of:
   - `verified` — you opened the source this turn; record the citation (`path:line`, a symbol, `dep@version`, a doc URL, or — for a domain fact, when a knowledge corpus is present — a corpus document cited as `KB-NNNN@edition`).
   - `spike` — decidable only by a time-boxed investigation; **run it now** (a measurement, a throwaway prototype, a query against a real system) and record the one-line finding. A spike too large to run now surfaces as the first `/spectastic.tasks` item.
   - `assumed` — taken as true without verification because verifying now costs more than it's worth.

   Record every fact as a row in the design's **Grounding & evidence** section (claim → source → status → finding). This is the leading edge of the design: a reviewer reads it to see what the design *knows* versus *assumes*.

   **Grounding a domain fact against a knowledge corpus.** When a `knowledge/` corpus is present, a design-bearing **domain** fact — a settlement window, a regulatory threshold, a clinical rule — MAY be grounded `verified` by citing a corpus document as `KB-NNNN@edition` (the project-assigned, opaque, repo-unique id, resolved against the project's root `knowledge/index.md` registry) in the `<spec-decision>`'s Context. The edition pin matters: it names *which text* the claim was grounded against, so a later re-ingest at a newer edition can never silently change what the decision claimed — and it is always the referenced document's own edition, never the source marketplace's plugin version (the two are different axes). Before a corpus existed, a domain fact could only ever be `assumed`; the corpus is what lets it be `verified` against a document a reviewer can open. **Scope it to domain facts only** — a *local product decision* (a latency target, a UX choice, a stack pick) is not a domain fact and MUST NOT manufacture a corpus citation; a corpus asked to justify everything justifies nothing and hollows out the `verified` signal.

   **Skip what's known.** Facts you just verified don't need re-asking; check `$ARGUMENTS` and the spec too, and only interview for what grounding left genuinely open.

7. **Two-phase interview.** Discovery in chat (narrative), decisions via `AskUserQuestion` (bounded choice). Unresolved questions in the final design signal that the interview failed. When none remain, represent zero per `REQ-AUTHOR-005`: the `<spec-questions>` register carries no `<li>` — put any "resolved because…" rationale in a `<p>`, never a "None" `<li>` (each `<li>` reads as one open question to consumers).

   **Chat phase (narrative answers):**
   - High-level approach in one or two paragraphs
   - The 1–3 alternatives that were seriously considered + the criteria that mattered
   - Project structure — only the new or changed paths
   - Risks with likelihood, impact, and mitigation

   **Decision phase — use `AskUserQuestion` to anchor before writing:**
   - **Test style** (e.g. TDD / integration-first / smoke-only — pick the one with the strongest defence; recommend first)
   - **Risk tolerance** for this design (Low — proven path / Medium — some unknowns / High — experimental)
   - **Architecture pattern** — when the feature has more than one moving part (the same bar as the **Approach** section's architecture sketch in step 8), anchor *how the pieces are arranged* before the stack picks. Offer the domain- and stack-appropriate contenders (e.g. **layered** / **hexagonal ports-and-adapters** / **vertical-slice** / **modular-monolith**), recommending the *simplest structure the complexity actually needs* — **prompt, don't prescribe** a house pattern. The pick lands a `<spec-decision>` in **Decisions** (with `grounding=`) that shapes the **Project structure** sketch, and its one-line summary fills the **Technical context** Architecture row. Standing, cross-feature rules (dependency direction, "no framework in the domain core") belong in `principles.html`, not here; a trivial single-module feature skips this question. (The prompt is advisory per P-8 / T-009 — it nudges a deliberate, grounded choice; the durable enforcement, an architecture fitness function, is a separate effort.)
   - **Dependencies** (080-unit-edge-authoring, FR-005) — asked when the project plausibly has any: more than one unit in the workspace, or a declared interface contract. A single-module project with no interface is *not* asked; a speculative question trains authors to dismiss the prompt. What does this work depend on — a sibling module, or a unit in another repository? A confirmed answer is written through `spectastic units:add` (FR-006), never by a second writer, so there is one path to the config and one place for its refusals.
   - **Interface shape** (069-design-contract-section, FR-004) — asked before any format question: what interface, if any, does this feature expose — request/response, RPC, GraphQL, event-driven, or none? For event-driven, ask a direction sub-question — publishes, consumes, or both (a feature MAY expose both an HTTP surface and an event stream, per FR-007). Skipped when the spec, an upstream artifact, or detection already answers it. Fills the **Data model & contracts** section's `<spec-contract shape=… direction=…>`.
   - **Contract format** (FR-005) — seeded from the declared interface shape, never a fixed default: request/response → OpenAPI, RPC → proto, GraphQL → GraphQL SDL, event-driven → AsyncAPI. A feature declaring both an HTTP surface and an event stream seeds both formats — one `<spec-contract>` per declared interface, never a forced single choice. Presents no crown — the `(Recommended)` label from the Rules below is withheld here — when nothing decisive implies a winner (honours 050 FR-002's crownless-when-unearned stance). Fills the `path=`/`format=` attributes directly.

   **The sidecar convention** (070-contract-sidecar-convention, FR-001/FR-005): `path=` names the **effective** location and only that — the ecosystem-conventional path this design declares, which must resolve outside `specs/`. It is not a second name for the sidecar, and an earlier version of this paragraph said it named "two locations across its lifecycle", which one attribute cannot do and which the validator rejected outright. While the design is in flight, author the contract at `specs/<spec-id>/contracts/` — the **proposed** location, tracked alongside the spec and found by promotion from the declared path's basename. The effective path will not resolve until promotion runs, and that is expected: a declared effective contract with a proposed sibling is *pending promotion* and reports nothing (070 FR-008). Do **not** pre-create the effective file to quiet a validate error — two readable copies with no captured baseline is itself an error (070 FR-009), because it performs promotion's write by hand and leaves two copies that can drift. That directory is always named `contracts/` — the knowledge corpus's citable-documents directory is a distinct, unrelated convention and its name doesn't apply here.
   - **Contract coordinate name** (076-contract-export-handover, FR-007) — asked where the key becomes load-bearing: when the contract is expected to be referenced from outside its own project, or when the project declares more than one. Otherwise the basename fallback serves, and asking would be ceremony. The answer fills `name=`; two contracts in one project resolving to the same name is a validate error, so a rename or a shared basename cannot silently re-key a coordinate downstream references.
   - **Event compatibility direction** (077-event-schema-evolution, FR-001) — asked only when the design is changing a declared event-driven contract's payload; a design changing no published payload is asked nothing (FR-004/SC-001). When it fires: what compatibility does this change intend for *future* messages — backward, forward, full, or none? Every option states its meaning inline (never the bare registry term alone), and presents no crown — the familiar `backward` default is not recommended, since nothing in the context earns it. Fills the `compatibility=` attribute on the changed `<spec-contract>`.
   - **Event compatibility scope** (FR-003) — asked alongside the direction question above, distinguishing compatibility for *future* messages (the direction question) from readability of *already-published* ones: does the claim hold against the latest version only, or against every retained message? This is the **replay** question — a diff-based check silently collapses it, since replayed messages may have been written many versions ago. Fills the `compatibility-scope=` attribute (`latest` or `all`) alongside `compatibility=`.
   - **Visual surface** (093-design-visual-section, FR-008) — asked **before** anything about tokens or screens, and skipped entirely, with every follow-up below it, when the project has no user interface. Does a person see this feature? Detection reads root manifests and conventional project files, and a native app whose UI framework ships in the platform SDK is seen by its project directory rather than by a dependency. A project the tool classifies wrongly may still declare, and a declaration outranks detection **in both directions** — a declared surface stands where nothing was detected, a declared none stands where something was. Fills `<spec-visual shape=…>`; `none` is the honest answer for a feature inside an interface project that touches no screen.
   - **Token set and screens** (FR-005; located by 094-visual-sidecar-convention) — asked only where the answer above is a surface. The convention answers *where* before you ask: the **project's** token set lives at `visual/` in the project root, and **this feature's** screens live at `specs/<spec-id>/visual/`, beside the spec that owns them. The same name at two scopes is deliberate, mirroring the contract convention where a proposed and an effective contract share a name and differ by location. Either may name a directory rather than a file, and either may be subdivided beneath its conventional location — a token set split by mode is the normal case. So the question is not *where* but *what is there*: confirm the paths and, where the set extends a package, record the base as external and declare only the local overrides. The token set is project-scoped and identical for every feature, so offer the path an existing design already declares rather than asking a second time — **two designs declaring different token paths is an error**, not a merge. Do not place material here that already has an owning convention: a contract belongs at its own declared location, a citable document to the knowledge corpus.
   - **Variant grid and coverage** (FR-005, FR-012, FR-013; the grid itself is 096-visual-variant-grid) — asked only where the answer above is a surface, and **only where the project has a grid**. Nothing obliges it to: 096 FR-008 governs the grid's scope, not its existence, so a single-axis product should never be pushed into authoring a fictional one to satisfy a question. Where a grid does exist it is project-scoped like the token set, so offer the path an existing design already declares rather than asking twice — two designs naming different grids is an error, not a merge. Unlike the token set it must name a **file**: a grid declares its axes in an explicit resolution order taken from their source position, which a directory does not have. Then ask which of that grid's contexts *this feature* addresses, as `axis=context` pairs or the single word `all`. **Recording nothing is a third value** and means *not recorded* — neither full coverage nor none — so if the answer is "all of them", say so explicitly rather than leaving it blank; silence must not be read as a claim nobody made. A named context the grid does not declare is a typo and is reported; one the grid **declines with a reason** is a disagreement with a recorded decision, reported differently and worth surfacing to the author rather than fixing silently.
   - **Design source** (FR-006) — where the design came from. Provenance for a reader, never an authority: nothing resolves it, nothing fetches it, and a project whose design tool is gone stays valid. A surface built by hand with no design tool records that rather than leaving it blank.
   - **Perf budget** for any NFR mentioned in chat — get a quantified number (e.g. "p95 latency under 200 ms / 500 ms / 1 s / not in scope")
   - **Coverage threshold** — for a project with a coverage floor (the `coverage` enforce category), quantify the target the way Perf targets are, but state it **diff-aware**: a patch target for *changed* lines (e.g. 80% / 90% / 100% of new lines covered) plus the standing rule that *a change never lowers coverage of the code it touches* — **never a single universal project percentage** (a mandated number is a Goodhart target and 100% is a smell; the discipline is the invariant, not the number). Fills the **Technical context** Coverage row; `not in scope` for a project with no coverage floor (Lean).
   - **Persistence shape** if storage was discussed (e.g. SQL / KV / object store / in-memory only)
   - **Each tech-stack pick** that has 2–4 reasonable contenders (language version, async runtime, test framework, etc.)
   - **Stack-selection interview** (unconditional — no configuration key gates it; see 050 FR-002 for why the advertised one was withdrawn) — **read detection and the standing docs first**: `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/any linked architecture doc, the repo's detected ecosystem, and the profile's `frameworks` axis stance. For every **undecided** material stack dimension (language, framework, test framework, coverage tool, persistence, build tool — not a fixed list): skip it if a source above already answers it; surface — **never silently resolve** — a conflict where two sources disagree; otherwise offer it as a bounded choice via `AskUserQuestion`, seeding the recommendation from those same sources — **never a maintained house catalog** — with no `(Recommended)` crown when nothing decisive implies a winner. A confirmed pick fills the matching **Technical context** row directly, and (settled either way — confirmed or self-skipped) auto-scaffolds its `<spec-decision>` in **Decisions**: the offered contenders become the Considered Options (pre-filled, not retyped), and the recommendation source is captured as a decision driver. Coordinates with, never duplicates, the Architecture-pattern question above and the profile's enforcement-tool resolution (step 5b).
   - **Frameworks-axis tie-break** — when the stack-selection interview's context doesn't decisively pick a winner, break the tie using the profile's `frameworks` axis: `minimal` leans stdlib/no-dep, `conventional` leans mainstream, `staff-level` leans the mature, batteries-included choice. Detection and standing docs still dominate — this only breaks a tie among otherwise-equal contenders.
   - **Each candidate ADR** the chat surfaced — get a thumbs-up on the framing before scaffolding the decision card

   Rules:
   - ≤4 questions per `AskUserQuestion` call, 2–4 options each, multiSelect off unless explicitly batch-style.
   - First option is the recommendation, labelled `"(Recommended)"` in the label.
   - For >4 alternatives, ask in chat instead and let the user narrate the tradeoff.

8. **Discipline**:
   - Decisions follow the ADR shape: Status / Context / Decision / Consequences (with `+` positives and `−` negatives).
   - **Every decision declares its grounding.** Each `<spec-decision>` carries `grounding="verified|spike|assumed|n-a"` (`n-a` = pure judgment with no external fact, e.g. a test-style preference) and its Context cites the backing **Grounding & evidence** row's source (`<code>src/foo.ts:88</code>`, `dep@version`, a URL). A decision missing the attribute, or `grounding="assumed"`, renders the visible `UNGROUNDED` label — the design-time analogue of a `<spec-delta>` rendering `MISSING OP`. "We'll use X because it's standard" is not a citation; "X — lockfile resolves `x@4.2`, `x.foo()` confirmed in `dist/index.d.ts:88`" is.
   - Decisions have stable IDs `D-001`, `D-002`, … forever. Superseded decisions keep status `superseded` and link to the replacement.
   - The architecture sketch (inline SVG) is **required** if the feature has more than one moving part. Keep it small — fewer than ~8 boxes; if you need more, sketch the slice, not the system.
   - Alternatives must include a scored matrix with one row marked `data-winner`. The winner must be the one actually chosen.
   - **Delete the Visual surface section outright** in a project with no user interface — detected or declared. The template scaffolds it unconditionally because a static file cannot vary per project; a populated section where none belongs is an error, and an absent one is reported as nothing at all. Absence, not emptiness.
   - Do not duplicate the spec. Link to its requirement IDs (`<a href="./spec.html#FR-001">FR-001</a>`) rather than restating them.

8b. **Materialise the design's embedded views** (099-visual-embedded-view, FR-003). Run `spectastic materialise <spec-id>`. It derives the declared contract and the declared screens into the design that declares them, and is idempotent — running it again after changing either remakes the view and changes nothing otherwise.

   This step exists because the kernel verb's own materialisation never reaches this path: `/spectastic.design` copies a template and interviews, and 006 FR-009 makes *this* the canonical path. Skipping it is caught rather than tolerated — an absent visual view is reported (099 FR-005), which is the deliberate divergence from the contract view whose permissive `MAY` let the same gap go unnoticed for months.

9. **Validate**. Re-walk the Principles check — does any decision now violate a principle you marked OK earlier? If yes, fix the decision or escalate. Then re-walk the **grounding gate** (`REQ-LIFECYCLE-006`, the binding clause): the design is **not ready for `/spectastic.tasks`** while any `must`-tier decision is `grounding="assumed"` or an unresolved `grounding="spike"`. For each, have the user choose — the choice is theirs to commit, not yours — via `AskUserQuestion`:
   - **Verify** — read the source now; flip the **Grounding & evidence** row and the decision to `verified` with a citation.
   - **Spike** — run the time-boxed investigation now (record the finding), or schedule it as the first `/spectastic.tasks` item.
   - **Accept the risk** — record `<spec-risk target="D-NNN" status="accepted">` with the user's one-line rationale; leave it `identified` until the user confirms, exactly as in propose's risk-register step.

   This gate is a design→tasks *readiness* affirmation, not a Draft content-lock (P-6) — it mirrors the estimability gate in step 2. Should/may-tier and `n-a` decisions warn but do not block.

## Spikes state their claim before they run

A spike that succeeds is rarely re-read to ask what it demonstrated, and the gap between the question asked and the question needed is invisible once the answer is green (`000/T-033`).

So: **write down what the spike will establish before running it**, and have the decision it feeds cite that claim rather than the spike. A design once grounded its hardest choices rigorously and still shipped an unrunnable artifact, because its spike proved the target *built* — and produced a bare executable with no application metadata. Building is not running, and the weaker result was recorded as if it were the stronger one.

The neighbouring discipline already exists for artifacts — a structural check does not prove behaviour — and this is the same failure one stage earlier, where a decision is grounded rather than where an artifact is verified.

## Output style

- Replace every `[PLACEHOLDER]`.
- Decisions favor brevity. A four-line Decision row is better than a paragraph.
- Use `<spec-warning>` for risks the user must accept before implementation; use `<spec-assumption>` for things this design takes as true.
- Use `<spec-sidenote>` for an aside the reader may skip without losing the argument — a caveat, or the thing you nearly did instead. A `<spec-note>` sits in the flow and must not be missed; a sidenote sits beside it. Both templates now scaffold one, commented out.

## After writing

Report the path, the principles version checked against, and a one-line grounding summary (how many facts `verified` / `spike` / `assumed`). Propose `/spectastic.tasks` to derive the work list **only once the grounding gate is clear** — if a must-tier decision is still ungrounded and unaccepted, name that as the blocker instead.

## Optional: CLI dispatch

Per 006 FR-009: for deterministic dispatch outside Claude Code (CI scripts, raw shell automation), the LLM MAY invoke `spectastic design` via Bash. This bypasses LLM-driven file handling and routes through `@spectastic/core/commands/design` directly. The markdown procedure above remains canonical; the CLI is an alternate code path.

The CLI requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment for AI-coupled verbs; the slash-command path uses the in-host Claude session and needs no key.

### Landing a design export in the same run

`spectastic design <spec-id> --visuals <export>` performs the design generation, then imports, renders and materialises the export's embedded view — all in one invocation, instead of the design generation followed by three separate commands run by hand. A bad export path is checked and refused before the (costly) generation step ever runs, never after. `--no-render` skips the rendering step specifically — import and materialise still run, no browser required — for a run where a browser isn't available or isn't wanted.

Interactively authoring a design through this command's own interview (the Visual surface question above) is the surface that actually declares what `--visuals` later imports and renders into: the flag lands material, it does not decide whether a feature has one.
